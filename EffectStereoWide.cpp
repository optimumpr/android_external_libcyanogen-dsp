/**
 * Explanation of the effect:
 *
 * In order to achieve a stereo widening effect, we use three methods
 * combined in one effect that can be toggled on the user interface.
 *
 * First, we assume we have an MS matrix, and we basically shift towards
 * S rather than M, cutting down the center channel, and enhancing the
 * separate L/R channels (slightly).
 *
 * Second, for songs that might not have a good stereo image, we
 * apply a short delay on the L or R channel (after high-pass)
 * to simlate a stereo effect. This is the most noticeable effect.
 *
 * Finally, the third method is based on a split EQ effect. We basically
 * apply an EQ only to the S part of the MS matrix, making the S signal
 * sound crisper, thus giving a subtle boost to the stereo image.
 *
